# String Input and Output in C++

## Description
This program demonstrates how to read a string input from the user and display it using C++. The program uses the `getline` function to read the entire line of input, including spaces, and then prints the entered string.

## How It Works
- The program prompts the user to enter a string.
- The `getline` function is used to read the input string from the standard input (cin).
- The entered string is then printed to the console.
